# Zebra-Batch-Printing

Switched to using Zebra Designer for printing and needed a way to batch print with barcodes.

Simply enter the beginning asset number and quantity of labels you want to print and click the generate button or hit enter.
Copies the label code to the clipboard which can then be directly sent to the printer.

Creates a local sqlite db to log each set of labels that is printed with the starting tag, amount, and the datetime.
